#### github workflow (action)

Have two jobs for build  and bum version and release

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

name: Create release

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build pkg
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: Build
        run: |
          yarn -y && yarn build
      - name: Upload build
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: ars
          path: build
  release-please:
    name: Bump+CL+release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Download build
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: ars
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          package-name: ars
          path: build/
          pull-request-title-pattern: "chore${scope}: to release${component} ${version}"

```

#### manifest
```json
{
  ".": "1.0.0"
}
```

#### config
```json
{
  "release-type": "node",
  "packages": {
    ".": {
      "changelog-path": "CHANGELOG.md",
      "release-type": "node",
      "bump-minor-pre-major": false,
      "bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major": false,
      "draft": false,
      "prerelease": false
    }
  },
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleapis/release-please/main/schemas/config.json"
}
```

### Conventional commit message part:

Release Please assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

`fix`: which represents _bug fixes_, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) patch.   
`feat`: which represents a _new feature_, and correlates to a SemVer minor.   
`feat!`:, or fix!:, refactor!:, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a SemVer major.   

#### Examples
```text
feat: adds v4 UUID to crypto

This adds support for v4 UUIDs to the library.

fix(utils): unicode no longer throws exception
  PiperOrigin-RevId: 345559154
  BREAKING-CHANGE: encode method no longer throws.
  Source-Link: googleapis/googleapis@5e0dcb2

feat(utils): update encode to support unicode
  PiperOrigin-RevId: 345559182
  Source-Link: googleapis/googleapis@e5eef86
```
The above commit message will contain:

* an entry for the "adds v4 UUID to crypto" feature.
* an entry for the fix "unicode no longer throws exception", along with a note that it's a breaking change.
* an entry for the feature "update encode to support unicode"

### Bump version

```git commit -m "chore: release 2.0.0\n\nRelease-As: 2.0.0"```

> ⚠️  A releasable unit is a commit to the branch with one of the following prefixes: "**feat**", "**fix**", and "**deps**". (A "chore" or "build" commit is not a releasable unit.)

### Fix release notes (during merge PR, squash message, or amend commit)

```text
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
feat: add ability to override merged commit message

fix: another message
chore: a third message
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```
